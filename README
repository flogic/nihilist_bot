TODO:

 - make parser formats into discoverable subclasses(?) ... may need to implement ordering
 - add more BotSender targets
 - make the BotSender subclasses register automatically by discovery.
 - diagnose: what is the problem with trying to start with the big-switch.rb command.  Currently start with 'ruby genesis.rb'
